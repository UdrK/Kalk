Kalk - A probabilistic calculator

Kalc is a QT application exercise in oop written in C++. The main design pattern used is mvc.
It allows its user to declare and use descrete random variables for simple calculations. These variables support different operations based on the type they are.

Supported random variables are:
* Bernoulli distribution
* Binomial distribution
* Geometric distribution
* Negative binomial (or Pascal) distribution
* Skellam distribution
* Poisson distribution
* Hypergeometric distribution
